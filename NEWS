12 June 2020 - mptcpd 0.5

- Test plugins are no longer installed when running "make install".  A
  side benefit of the changes is that test plugins only build when the
  test suite is built via "make check" or "make distcheck".  Libtool
  relink warnings that occurred when building the tests have also been
  addressed.

- VPATH builds where the build directory and source directory
  differ (e.g. "mkdir build; cd build; ../configure; make") now
  succeed.

21 May 2020 - mptcpd 0.4

- Plugins may now inform peers that an address is no longer being
  advertised through the new mptcpd_pm_remove_addr() function.  This
  corresponds to the MPTCP protocol REMOVE_ADDR option.

- Network monitoring related events are now propagated to plugins.
  Events are triggered upon the addition, update, and removal of a
  network interface (link), as well as the addition and removal of a
  network address.  Plugins interested in receiving any of these
  events need only implement the corresponding callback in the
  `mptcpd_plugin_ops' API found in `<mptcpd/plugin.h>'.

- Stub implementations for unused mptcpd plugin operations are no
  longer needed.  Simply set the unused field in the
  `mptcpd_plugin_ops' structure to NULL.

- This will be the last release to support the Linux 4.x based kernel
  on multipath-tcp.org.  Subsequent releases will support the new API
  found in the "multipath-tcp/mptcp_net-next" kernel on GitHub
  currently being used for development of patch submissions to the
  upstream Linux kernel network subsystem maintainers.

18 December 2019 - mptcpd 0.3

- This is the Multipath TCP Daemon beta release.

- All known memory leaks have been fixed.

- A potential security hole related to logging of MPTCP connection
  tokens was closed.  Logging of MPTCP connection tokens no longer
  occurs.

- Support for compiler-based address, leak, and undefined behavior
  sanitizers is now available, and may be enabled through
  corresponding `configure' script options.  Run `./configure --help'
  for the full list of options.

- Diagnostic messages will be issued if the Linux kernel is not
  properly configured to support a user space MPTCP path manager like
  mptcpd.

- Documentation on how to contribute to mptcpd is available in the
  `CONTRIBUTING.md' file.

- A pkg-config `mptcpd.pc' file is now generated and installed to
  allow plugin developers to more easily obtain the necessary mptcpd
  build related information, such as compiler and linker command line
  flags.

- The mptcpd plugin API dropped the mptcpd_addr type in favor of the
  standard sockaddr family of structures.

- Debugger-friendly optimization is now supported.

- ELL 0.27 or better is now required due to changes in the ELL generic
  netlink API.

11 June 2019 - mptcpd 0.2a

- This Multipath TCP Daemon alpha release replaces support for the
  deprecated MPTCP generic netlink API with the one found in the
  multipath-tcp.org kernel (0.95+), and has been verified to work with
  that kernel.

- Several actual and potential memory access violations were fixed in
  the mptcpd network monitor, path manager, and "sspi" plugin.

- The mptcp.service systemd service file now correctly grants the
  necessary privilege (CAP_NET_ADMIN) for proper operation of the
  mptcpd program.

27 March 2019 - mptcpd 0.1a

- This is the initial (alpha) release of the Multipath TCP Daemon
  "mptcpd".  It implements MPTCP path management in the user space by
  providing a framework that bridges user defined path management
  strategies - i.e. mptcpd plugins - with the Linux kernel side MPTCP
  implementation over a generic netlink interface.

- The generic netlink interface employed by the Multipath TCP Daemon
  is based on an early proposal, and will be superseded by the
  interface available in the MPTCP development kernel, i.e.:
        https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp/commit/4ea5dee

- In addition to the kernel/user space path management bridging, the
  Multipath TCP Daemon also monitors changes to local network
  interfaces and addresses that path management strategies may choose
  to leverage.  Currently, network interfaces and addresses may be
  queried (pulled).  A network event notification mechanism for
  plugins is currently a work-in-progress.

- A single-subflow-per-interface - "sspi" - plugin is included in the
  source distribution as a reference.   It enforces a single subflow
  per network interface per MPTCP connection policy.  Available local
  addresses are also sent to the kernel so that they may be advertised
  to the peer through a MPTCP ADD_ADDR option.  The current
  implementation depends on the remote peer to initiate subflows,
  which may then be allowed or closed per this plugin's policy.
  Explicitly adding new subflows through this plugin is currently
  unsupported, but is expected to be implemented in the future.
