11 June 2019 - mptcpd 0.2a

- This Multipath TCP Daemon alpha release replaces support for the
  deprecated MPTCP generic netlink API with the one found in the
  multipath-tcp.org kernel (0.95+), and has been verified to work with
  that kernel.

- Several actual and potential memory access violations were fixed in
  the mptcpd network monitor, path manager, and "sspi" plugin.

- The mptcp.service systemd service file now correctly grants the
  necessary privilege (CAP_NET_ADMIN) for proper operation of the
  mptcpd program.

27 March 2019 - mptcpd 0.1a

- This is the initial (alpha) release of the Multipath TCP Daemon
  "mptcpd".  It implements MPTCP path management in the user space by
  providing a framework that bridges user defined path management
  strategies - i.e. mptcpd plugins - with the Linux kernel side MPTCP
  implementation over a generic netlink interface.

- The generic netlink interface employed by the Multipath TCP Daemon
  is based on an early proposal, and will be superseded by the
  interface available in the MPTCP development kernel, i.e.:
        https://github.com/multipath-tcp/mptcp/commit/4ea5dee

- In addition to the kernel/user space path management bridging, the
  Multipath TCP Daemon also monitors changes to local network
  interfaces and addresses that path management strategies may choose
  to leverage.  Currently, network interfaces and addresses may be
  queried (pulled).  A network event notification mechanism for
  plugins is currently a work-in-progress.

- A single-subflow-per-interface - "sspi" - plugin is included in the
  source distribution as a reference.   It enforces a single subflow
  per network interface per MPTCP connection policy.  Available local
  addresses are also sent to the kernel so that they may be advertised
  to the peer through a MPTCP ADD_ADDR option.  The current
  implementation depends on the remote peer to initiate subflows,
  which may then be allowed or closed per this plugin's policy.
  Explicitly adding new subflows through this plugin is currently
  unsupported, but is expected to be implemented in the future.
